# SyncFlow Node Client

This is a reusable node client implementation for SyncFlow. The idea here is to create necessary functionality to interact with the `SyncFlow` api, in a NodeJS application. Primary beneficiaries of this package could be clients to SyncFlow, who have their own backend in NodeJS and want to integrate with `SyncFlow`.
